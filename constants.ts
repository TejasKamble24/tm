          id: "Q6",
          question: "Why does adoption drop after training?",
          answer: "“Adoption drops mainly because of behavioral habits. Teachers revert to traditional methods unless they see quick wins, get reinforcement, and feel confident using the panel in real classrooms.”"

          id: "Q9",
          question: "How will you ensure schools see value in the first 2 weeks?",
          answer: "“I will focus on quick wins — teacher login activation, one live success demo, and simple features like annotation or quizzes. Early value prevents drop-off.”"
        },
        {
          id: "Q10",
          question: "What is the biggest reason teachers resist smart classroom tech?",
          answer: "“Mostly comfort with old habits and bandwidth/confidence. Adoption improves when we reduce friction, start simple, and support them until they feel comfortable.”"
        },
        {
          id: "Q11",
          question: "What adoption challenges do you anticipate while driving usage at TM?",
          answer: "“Since I am joining TM now, I have not yet faced challenges directly within TM accounts. However, based on my previous experience working with schools and my understanding of connected classroom adoption, I can clearly anticipate the key challenges I will face while driving adoption at TM.\n\nThe first challenge is teacher behavior change. Even after training, many teachers naturally revert to traditional teaching methods because that is what they are comfortable with. So the real challenge is not awareness, but making the panel part of their daily routine.\n\nThe second challenge is uneven adoption across staff. In most schools, a few teachers adopt quickly, while others remain inactive. So driving full adoption requires identifying low-usage teachers early, building internal champions, and reinforcing usage until it becomes institutional.\n\nThe third challenge is ensuring leadership alignment. Adoption improves significantly when principals and coordinators actively monitor usage and encourage teachers. Without leadership ownership, the panel can remain optional instead of mandatory.\n\nAnother challenge is operational friction — such as time constraints in school schedules, exam periods, or occasional technical support needs. Even small friction points can reduce usage if not resolved quickly.\n\nFinally, one of the biggest challenges is showing measurable value early. Schools need to feel that TM is improving classroom engagement and teacher productivity, otherwise renewal risk increases.\n\nThat is why my approach will focus on quick wins, weekly adoption tracking, school champions, and leadership governance — so that adoption becomes consistent, scalable, and renewal-ready.\n\nSo overall, the biggest adoption challenges at TM will be habit-building, stakeholder alignment, and sustained classroom usage — and that is exactly where I will focus my execution.”"

          id: "Q31",
          question: "What challenges did you face while driving adoption at BYJU’S?",
          answer: "“At BYJU’S, the biggest challenge while driving adoption was ensuring consistent student engagement after enrollment. Many students and parents had high expectations at the time of purchase, but actual usage often dropped after the initial excitement phase.\n\nOne major challenge was building a learning routine. Students would log in initially but then usage would become irregular due to school workload, exams, or lack of self-discipline. This showed that access to content alone does not guarantee learning outcomes.\n\nAnother challenge was parental involvement. In many cases, parents assumed the platform would work automatically, without active monitoring. When parents were not involved, student engagement dropped significantly. So adoption was not just a student problem, but a family-level behavior challenge.\n\nWe also faced challenges around content overload. Some learners felt overwhelmed by the volume of content and didn’t know what to focus on. This sometimes reduced motivation instead of increasing it.\n\nAdditionally, there were cases where expectation mismatch existed — parents expected instant results, while learning outcomes require consistent usage over time. Managing expectations and aligning them with realistic progress timelines was a critical part of driving adoption.\n\nTo address these challenges, we focused on identifying early usage drop-off signals, structured follow-ups, simplifying learning paths, and encouraging routine-based learning. These efforts helped improve engagement and long-term retention.\n\nThis experience taught me that adoption is not driven by product quality alone — it is driven by habit-building, expectation management, and continuous engagement.”"

      questions: [
        {
          id: "Q32",
          question: "What challenges did you face while driving adoption at Next Education?",
          answer: "“At Next Education, driving adoption was directly linked to how teachers used the solution in real classrooms, and that came with several practical challenges.\n\nThe first major challenge was teacher resistance to change. Even after training, many teachers preferred traditional methods because they were comfortable with chalk-and-board teaching. Some teachers felt that digital tools would disrupt their teaching flow or increase their workload initially.\n\nThe second challenge was low confidence during live classroom situations. Teachers might understand the tool during training, but when they had to use it in front of students, they hesitated. They were worried about making mistakes or losing control of the class while using technology.\n\nAnother challenge was uneven adoption across staff. In most schools, a few tech-friendly teachers would adopt quickly, but others would remain inactive. This created partial adoption, where the school was not getting full value from the solution.\n\nA fourth challenge was time and scheduling constraints. Schools have busy timetables, exams, and academic pressure, so it was difficult to gather all teachers repeatedly for training or follow-ups.\n\nWe also faced challenges around leadership involvement. Adoption improved significantly when principals actively encouraged usage, but in some cases, leadership treated it as a teacher-level tool rather than a school-wide priority.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, I focused on small classroom-level quick wins instead of repeating full training. I supported teachers in their first few live sessions, introduced features gradually, built teacher champions within the school, and aligned with principals so adoption became institutional rather than optional.\n\nThis experience taught me that in school environments, adoption is not achieved through training alone — it requires habit-building, continuous reinforcement, and stakeholder alignment.\n\nThat is why my adoption approach is always outcome-focused — ensuring the product becomes part of daily classroom routine, which ultimately drives retention and renewals.”"
